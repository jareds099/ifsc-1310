        <h2>Old Reliable</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Gordo was one of the first monkeys to make it into space as part of   <!-- <p> tag for a small paragraph -->
        NASA's space program. Eight monkeys had flown on NASA missions before
        him, five of whom went by the name of Albert.</p>
        <p>Gordo's <strong>historic</strong> flight took place on                <!-- <p> tag with <strong> and <em>, for bold and italics respectively -->
        <em>December 13, 1958</em> when he took off from Cape Canaveral for a
        15 minute flight into space.Even though he was <strong>weightless for
        over 8 minutes</strong> the on-board instruments indicatedthat Gordo
        enjoyed his journey into space. Scientists monitoring theflight were
        pleased to note that the only slight side effect Gordosuffered from the
        entry into space was a <strong>modest</strong> slowing ofhis pulse.</p>

        <h2>The Mission</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The rocket carrying Gordo into space would take off from the          <!-- Paragraph for "The Mission" -->
        Atlantic Missile Range at Cape Canaveral, travel further than any
        monkey had ever travelled before - over 1,500 miles - and reach a
        height of 310 miles (500 km) before returning to Earth and landing in
        the South Atlantic, 1,302 nautical miles south of Cape Canaveral.</p>

        first. Well, none of us wants to think that they're gonna send a monkey
        up to do a man's work ... what they're trying to do to us is send a man
        up to do a monkey's work."<cite>Deke Slayton, Mercury Seven Astronaut

        <h2>The Jupiter AM-13</h2>
        </header>
        <p>The Jupiter IRBM (Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile) was
        originally developed by the US Army as a long-range successor
        to its PGM-11 Redstone missile, but was eventually taken over
        and deployed by the USAF for political reasons. It was also the
        only one of the United States' early stategic ballistic
        missiles with some mobility.</p>

        <h2>The Journey</h2>
        </header>
        <p>Gordo wore a specially customised space suit custom made for a
        monkey about one foot tall. The space suit was fitted with instruments,
        including temperature meters and microphones which recorded his
        historic suborbital journey, considered one of the outstanding
        achievements of space research.</p>
        <p>Flight Time: 15 Minutes</p>
