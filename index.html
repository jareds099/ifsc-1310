  <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
  <p>Progressive Enhancement is extremely important because of one main thing: reachability. The idea behind it is to make your website as easy as possible to use for everyone, but at the same time, you want to support users who have the latest web technologies and can actually use JavaScript frameworks and the like.</p>
  <p>The concept of this accessibility is very similar to me because of another somewhat related idea. Without getting too off topic, Progressive Enhancement is present in video games as well. On specific consoles, you can play some games from the consoles before it.</p>
  <p>Another business practice may be to force users to upgrade to the newest software, if there is money involved in the process. However, I believe that in most cases, it would be best just to support as many users for as long as possible.</p>
  
  <h2>Dragon Project Revision and Reflection</h2>
  <p>I asked one of my technically inclined friends to give me a critique of my website. He thought the general design of the website was pretty good, even though I thought I may not have made the best design choices when I was creating it. He didn't like the SpaceX logo placement, and said that there was too much white space around the logos.</p>
  <p>I definitely started out well in the class. I tend to get a little bit lazy near the end of the semester, but usually I finish what I start. Honestly, my motivation to create and work on websites was more of a challenge than the actual task of writing CSS. I had to look up multiple CSS properties and how to correctly use them, but once I started to write the same line over and over, I began to learn how to write things like the border, padding, and margin properties from memory.</p>
  <p>Knowing what I know now, if I had to start the semester over, I probably wouldn't change much, if anything at all. I knew before I started this class that it would be more of a mental mountain to climb rather than a physical one (in terms of wanting to do the work as opposed to not being able to do the work). I've had this problem for the past couple semesters. It's a struggle, but I am seriously trying the best I can.</p>
  
  <p>---</p>
  <p>Overall this semester, I learned that I do not want to create websites as a career, at least on the front end for now. I'm definitely a more technical oriented person rather than a design oriented person.</p>
